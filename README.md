# Note Aching App

Ever ache to take a note? Yeah, me too.

Building off of [Bookmark Landing Page](https://github.com/rfloarea/bookmark-landing-page), I'm playing with similar concepts but with something a bit closer to having actual utility in my life. This will have no chance of dethroning my actual note taking app (Obsidian). But it's fun and I'm solidifying my understanding and improving my code literacy.

## Things figured out the hard way

1. Why I had `[object PointerEvent]` show in the title textarea for a whil
2. Why do new line characters `n\` seem to be added to storage items after page reload? I'll say more about that journey another time.
3. How to crash your browser with an infinite loop that creates node elements.
4. How to create, merge, and delete Git branches.
5. How nice it is to have a code that's reasonably extensible, and with a complete working knowledge of the program so that adding features happens almost by accident. The `TRASH EVERYTHING` button was a good example of this. It just sort of...happened. I'd like more of those experiences please and thank you.

## Things I had fun with

- Making the grid was fun! I hadn't done that in a while so it was like stretching your legs muscles after a long walk. A bit painful but ultimately good.
- Rereading `.forEach` documentation. I've noticed how much more readily I dive into documentation these days. For some reason, I sometimes have a mental block for simply asking questions. For some reason, I don't just search for the thing I'm curious about. Strange behavior for someone who enjoys learning so much.
- Using `for...of` loops! I really like them for some reason.
- I had lots of fun with the Very Good Style of the page :D It's gross and I love it. A guilty pleasure.
- Clarifying the proper order of retrieving data and modifying it and storing it and displaying it is a fun puzzle. It reminds me very much of the fox, goose, corn logic puzzle. Or those stacking/sorting/pouring puzzles.
