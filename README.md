# Note Aching App

Ever ache to take a note? Yeah, me too.

Building off of [Bookmark Landing Page](https://github.com/rfloarea/bookmark-landing-page), I'm playing with similar concepts but with something a bit closer to having actual utility in my life. This will have no chance of dethroning my actual note taking app (Obsidian). But it's fun and I'm solidifying my understanding and improving my code literacy.

## Things I have not figured out, yet

1. Why do new notes show `[object PointerEvent]` in the title textarea?
2. Why do new line characters `n\` seem to be added to storage items after page reload?

## Things I had fun with

- Making the grid was fun! I hadn't done that in a while so it was like stretching your legs muscles after a long walk. A bit painful but ultimately good.
- Rereading `.forEach` documentation. I've noticed how much more readily I dive into documentation these days. For some reason, I sometimes have a mental block for simply asking questions. For some reason, I don't just search for the thing I'm curious about. Strange behavior for someone who enjoys learning so much.
- I had lots of fun with the Very Good Style of the page :D It's gross and I love it. A guilty pleasure.
