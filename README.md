# Note Aching App

Ever ache to take a note? Yeah, me too.

Building off of [Bookmark Landing Page](https://github.com/rfloarea/bookmark-landing-page), I'm playing with similar concepts but with something a bit closer to having actual utility in my life. This will have no chance of dethroning my actual note taking app (Obsidian). But it's fun and I'm solidifying my understanding and improving my code literacy.
